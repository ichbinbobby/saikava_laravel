            classmate who is initially hostile towards her, but soon develops a
            crush on her. A running gag involves her becoming overwhelmingly
            flushed with bliss every time she and Kanna make physical contact.</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">
  Noticing Kanna staring longingly at passing students, Kobayashi and Tohru make arrangements for her to go to school, going with her to buy some supplies. On her first day of school, Kanna manages to make some friends, including classmate Riko Saikawa, while also receiving a keychain from Kobayashi. Later, Riko impulsively challenges some park-hogging delinquents to a game of dodgeball, prompting Tohru and the other dragons to join her team. After wiping the floor with the other team, the dragons decide to go against each other in a no-holds-barred battlefield.
