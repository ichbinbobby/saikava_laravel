            Orginally a character from the dragonmaid anime and known for her
            crush on the famous dragon loli, Saikawa soon became a hit on the
            internet. A running gag involves her becoming overwhelmingly
            flushed with bliss every time she and Kanna make physical contact.
            Due to Saikawas green longsleeve with a yellow rabbit, it came to
            my mind to combine her with Overwatchs favourite Korean mech pilot
            DVA. I gave Saikawa DVAs Headset and colored the rabbit on her
            longsleeve neonpink and that is how <b>SaikaVA</b> was born.

            My goal is it to create little arcade games playable in the browser
            and/or on mobile devices. Therefore I am learning to code next to
            creating SaikaVA memes. In order to avoid copyright problems in the
            future every game sprite needs to be open source or self-made. I
            would like to use simple pixelarts for that and I am looking for
            pixelartists and developers. The project is public on Github and
            you can contribute all you like or join us in our discord.

            Japanese: 小林さんちのメイドラゴン
            Kobayashi-san Chi no Meidoragon is a Japanese manga series
            written and illustrated by Coolkyoushinja. The series began
            serialization in Futabasha's Monthly Action magazine in May 2013,
            and is licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. A
            spin-off manga by Mitsuhiro Kimura began serialization in Monthly
            Action in December 2016. An anime television series produced by
            Kyoto Animation aired in Japan between January and April 2017.

            As office worker Kobayashi gets ready for work, she is greeted by a
            large dragon right outside her front door. The dragon immediately
            transforms into a human girl in a maid outfit, and introduces
            herself as Tohru. It turns out that during a drunken excursion into
            the mountains the night before, Kobayashi had encountered the
            dragon, who claims to have come from another world. Subsequently,
            Kobayashi had removed a holy sword from Tohru's back, earning her
            gratitude. With Tohru having no place to stay, Kobayashi offers to
            let the dragon stay at her home and become her personal maid, to
            which she agrees. As Kobayashi has forgotten her drunken offering,
            she is initially reluctant to allow the dragon into her home
            despite her previous promise, but a mix of guilt and the usefulness
            of Tohru's dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to accept her.
            Despite being efficient at housework, Tohru's unorthodox methods of
            housekeeping often end up scaring Kobayashi and bringing more
            trouble than help. Additionally, Tohru's presence attracts other
            dragons, gods, and mythical beings to her new home.
