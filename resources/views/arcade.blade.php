          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Kanna becomes downhearted when Kobayashi mentions she can't attend her school's sports festival due to work. Upon noticing Kanna hold back her selfishness after seeing how hard she works, Kobayashi works overtime in order to get the day off for the sports festival. During the festival, Kanna, Riko, and Shouta all take part in various events. During the final relay race, Riko falls behind after dropping her baton, but Kanna makes up the lost distance and wins the festival for her class. </h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">
            Riko has wavy brown hair, shoulder length. She has dark green eyes and usually dons a light-green, long sleeved shirt with a rounded yellow neckline fronted by a bunny motif, a pale orange skirt, white high socks, and green shoes. She sports a yellow-rimmed tag clipped to her shirt and an orange daisy pin in her hair.
